      <li>1 medium onion , diced</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic , minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chilli powder</li>
      <Li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</Li>
      <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <Li>½ teaspoon black pepper</Li>
      <Li>1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</Li>
      <Li>4 (10 inch) flour tortillas</Li>
      <Li>½ cup salsa</Li>
      <Li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</Li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
      <Li>2 green onions, chopped</Li>
      <Li>2 tomatoes, diced</Li>
      <Li>¼ cup thinly sliced jalapeño pepper</Li>
      <li>¼ cup sour cream (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol> 
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat 2 pie plates with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
    
    <li>Place ground beef, onion, and garlic in a skillet over medium heat. Cook until beef is evenly browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Season beef with chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper.</li>
    
    <li>Lay one tortilla in each pie plate, and cover with a layer of refried beans. Spread 1/2 of the seasoned ground beef over each one, and then cover with a second tortilla. Bake in the preheated oven until tortillas are crisp, about 10 minutes.</li>
   
    <li>Remove pizzas from the oven and set aside to cool slightly. Then spread 1/2 of the salsa over each top tortilla. Cover each pizza with 1/2 of the Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. Place 1/2 of the tomatoes, 1/2 of the green onions, and 1/2 of the jalapeño slices onto each one.</li>
    
    <li>Return pizzas to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 to 10 more minutes. Let pizzas cool slightly before slicing each one into 4 pieces.</li></ol>
